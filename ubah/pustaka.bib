abstract = {In the last decade, neutrosophic sets (NS), which are defined as the generalization of interval fuzzy sets, have become a hot topic in the computer-vision and machine-learning communities with a number of applications. Researchers in the field of computer vision have applied NS on various image-processing applications. Segmentation is a well-known process in image processing that aims to divide an input image into its regions. While the pixels in a given region should have the same property, the pixels in different regions should have different properties. In this chapter, a survey is presented on NS-based medical image segmentation. As the literature is explored, it is seen that NS-based image segmentation approaches have been applied on various medical images such as breast ultrasounds (BUS), liver computed tomography (CT), brain CTs, dermoscopy, retinal, eye angiography, dental X-rays, etc. Moreover, there have been numerous applications that have used NS in optical image segmentation. Especially, neutrosophic logic has applications in texture image segmentation. In these studies, NS has been generally used for either denoising or image enhancement. Moreover, in most studies, NS has been used for image segmentation. Besides the literature review, several well-known NS-based medical image segmentation approaches are introduced. In these methods, the NS was either used to improve the image quality by contrast enhancement and noise removal or to segment the image into regions of interest and background. The methodologies and results of the investigated methods are given in detail. The general limitations of the NS-based medical image segmentation approaches are also given. The chapter ends with some conclusions and future perspectives.}

	abstract = {Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a major preventable cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE), affects an estimated 1 per 1,000 people and contributes to 60,000–100,000 deaths annually. Normal blood physiology hinges on a delicate balance between pro- and anti-coagulant factors. Virchow’s Triad distills the multitude of risk factors for DVT into three basic elements favoring thrombus formation: venous stasis, vascular injury, and hypercoagulability. Clinical, biochemical, and radiological tests are used to increase the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing DVT. Anticoagulation therapy is essential for the treatment of DVT. With few exceptions, the standard therapy for DVT has been vitamin K-antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin with heparin or fractionated heparin bridging. More recently, a number of large-scale clinical trials have validated the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in place of warfarin in select cases. In this review, we summarize the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and medical management of DVT, with particular emphasis on anticoagulation therapy and the role of DOACs in the current treatment algorithm.},
